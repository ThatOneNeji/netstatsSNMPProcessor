Tables for such information should be contained in multicast specific MIBs, such as RFC 3019. While this table is writable, the user will note that several objects, such as ipAddressOrigin, are not. The intention in allowing a user to write to this table is to allow them to add or remove any entry that isn't permanent. The user should be allowed to modify objects and entries when that would not cause inconsistencies within the table. Allowing write access to objects, such as ipAddressOrigin, could allow a user to insert an entry and then label it incorrectly. Note well: When including IPv6 link-local addresses in this table, the entry must use an InetAddressType of 'ipv6z' in order to differentiate between the possible interfaces.",
