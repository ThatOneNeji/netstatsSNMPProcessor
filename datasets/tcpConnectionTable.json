Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value. If a management station sets this object to the value deleteTCB(12), then the TCB (as defined in [RFC793]) of the corresponding connection on the managed node is deleted, resulting in immediate termination of the connection. As an implementation-specific option, a RST segment may be sent from the managed node to the other TCP endpoint (note, however, that RST segments are not sent reliably).",
