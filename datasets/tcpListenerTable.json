    "description": "A table containing information about TCP listeners. A listening application can be represented in three possible ways: 1. An application that is willing to accept both IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams is represented by a tcpListenerLocalAddressType of unknown (0) and a tcpListenerLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length octet-string). 2. An application that is willing to accept only IPv4 or IPv6 datagrams is represented by a tcpListenerLocalAddressType of the appropriate address type and a tcpListenerLocalAddress of '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively. 3. An application that is listening for data destined only to a specific IP address, but from any remote system, is represented by a tcpListenerLocalAddressType of an appropriate address type, with tcpListenerLocalAddress as the specific local address. NOTE: The address type in this table represents the address type used for the communication, irrespective of the higher-layer abstraction. For example, an application using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via IPv4 between ::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would use InetAddressType ipv4(1)).",
